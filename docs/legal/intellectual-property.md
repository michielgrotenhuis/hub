## Appendix A: Examples of IP Ownership

For clarity, below are examples of how intellectual property ownership is typically allocated in a Store.icu implementation project:

### Client Owns:
- The specific configuration of the Client's Store.icu instance
- Custom designs created specifically for Client (logos, branding elements, etc.)
- Client-specific content, product information, and customer data
- Custom code written specifically for Client's unique business requirements
- Business logic specific to Client's operations
- Customer data and analytics gathered through the store

### Company Owns:
- Reusable frameworks and libraries developed by Company
- Development tools and methodologies
- Generic templates that can be repurposed for other clients
- API connectors not specifically developed for Client
- Workflow automation tools not specific to Client's business
- Knowledge and expertise gained during the implementation

### Store.icu Owns:
- The core Store.icu platform and all its built-in features
- Standard Store.icu themes and templates
- Store.icu APIs and developer tools
- Store.icu documentation and educational materials
- Store.icu marketplace apps and plugins

### Third Parties Own:
- Stock photography or licensed media content
- Open-source components (subject to their licenses)
- Third-party plugins and integrations
- Payment gateways and shipping provider interfaces

This classification helps clarify ownership expectations and prevents disputes during and after the implementation project.
