# Liability & Indemnification Terms

## Overview

This document provides standardized liability and indemnification terms that Store.icu partners can incorporate into their service agreements with clients. These provisions are designed to allocate risk fairly while protecting both parties from unreasonable liability exposure in ecommerce implementation projects.

**IMPORTANT**: These provisions should be reviewed by legal counsel before incorporation into your agreements. They may need to be adapted based on your specific services, client relationship, jurisdiction, and risk tolerance.

## Recommended Liability Provisions

### 1. Limitation of Liability

```

Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.4 (Exclusions from Limitations), the total cumulative liability of [PARTNER_NAME] to Client for any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, shall not exceed [SELECT ONE OPTION]:

   [OPTION A: TOTAL FEES PAID] the total amount of fees paid by Client to [PARTNER_NAME] under this Agreement during the [12/6/3] month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to liability.
   
   [OPTION B: SPECIFIC MONETARY CAP] [AMOUNT] ([AMOUNT_IN_WORDS] [CURRENCY]).

1.3 Allocation of Risk. The Parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability set forth in this Section reflect an allocation of risk between the Parties and form an essential basis of the bargain between them. The Parties acknowledge that the fees charged by [PARTNER_NAME] under this Agreement reflect these limitations, and that without these limitations, [PARTNER_NAME] would have charged substantially higher fees.

1.5 Third-Party Services. [PARTNER_NAME] shall not be liable for any failure, defect, or non-conformity in any third-party software, hardware, services, or platforms, including but not limited to the Store.icu platform, payment processors, shipping providers, or any third-party integrations requested by Client.

1.6 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, civil unrest, government action, strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, fire, explosion, pandemic, epidemic, or internet or communication failures.

   (c) to [PARTNER_NAME]'s knowledge, the deliverables provided by [PARTNER_NAME] will not infringe upon or violate any third-party intellectual property rights.

2.2 Remedy for Breach of Warranty. As Client's exclusive remedy and [PARTNER_NAME]'s sole obligation for breach of the warranty set forth in Section 2.1(b), [PARTNER_NAME] shall, at its option: (i) re-perform the non-conforming services at no additional charge to Client; or (ii) if re-performance is not commercially reasonable, refund to Client the fees paid for the non-conforming services.

2.3 Disclaimer. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 2.1, [PARTNER_NAME] MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. [PARTNER_NAME] DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES WILL MEET CLIENT'S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF ANY DELIVERABLES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT [PARTNER_NAME] DOES NOT CONTROL THE TRANSFER OF DATA OVER COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET, AND THAT THE SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF SUCH COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.

2.4 Third-Party Platform. CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE STORE.ICU PLATFORM IS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY AND NOT BY [PARTNER_NAME]. [PARTNER_NAME] MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE STORE.ICU PLATFORM, INCLUDING ITS AVAILABILITY, FUNCTIONALITY, OR SECURITY.

```

### 3. Implementation Acceptance

```
IMPLEMENTATION ACCEPTANCE

3.1 Acceptance Testing. Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, Client shall have [10-15] business days following [PARTNER_NAME]'s notification of completion of the implementation ("Acceptance Testing Period") to test the implementation for conformity with the specifications set forth in the Statement of Work.

3.2 Acceptance. The implementation shall be deemed accepted by Client upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
   (a) Client provides written notice of acceptance;
   (b) Client fails to notify [PARTNER_NAME] of any material non-conformities within the Acceptance Testing Period;
   (c) Client uses the implementation in a production environment or for business purposes; or
   (d) Client makes payment for the implementation without reservation.

This process shall repeat until the implementation is accepted, provided that if [PARTNER_NAME] fails to correct the non-conformities after [2-3] resubmissions, Client may terminate the applicable Statement of Work and receive a refund of fees paid for the non-conforming implementation.

3.4 Acceptance of Partial Deliverables. If the implementation is being delivered in phases or modules, Client may be required to accept each phase or module separately as specified in the Statement of Work. Acceptance of one phase or module shall not affect Client's right to reject any other phase or module that does not conform to the specifications.

```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. How to Use These Provisions

1. **Consultation with Legal Counsel**: These provisions are templates and should be reviewed by your legal counsel before incorporation into your agreements.

2. **Integration with Master Services Agreement**: These liability and indemnification terms should be incorporated into your Master Services Agreement (MSA) or your standard Terms and Conditions.

3. **Customization**: Replace all placeholders (e.g., [PARTNER_NAME], [AMOUNT]) with appropriate information specific to your business and client relationship.

4. **Jurisdiction Considerations**: These provisions are drafted with common law jurisdictions in mind. If you operate in a civil law jurisdiction, additional modifications may be necessary.

5. **Option Selection**: Where multiple options are provided (e.g., [OPTION A], [OPTION B]), select the most appropriate option for your specific circumstances and delete the others.

### 2. Key Considerations for Customization

#### Limitation of Liability Options

When determining the appropriate liability cap, consider:

- **Option A (Total Fees Paid)**: Most common approach, limiting liability to the amount the client has paid.
  - Advantages: Directly proportional to project value; easy to calculate.
  - Best for: Most standard implementation projects.

- **Option B (Specific Monetary Cap)**: Sets a fixed dollar amount as the maximum liability.
  - Advantages: Provides certainty regardless of project size.
  - Best for: Partners with strong bargaining power; very large projects where fee-based cap would be excessive.

- **Option C (Fees Multiplier)**: Limits liability to a multiple of fees paid.
  - Advantages: Balances project value with additional protection.
  - Best for: High-risk implementations; projects with significant business impact.

#### Insurance Requirements

When determining appropriate insurance coverage levels:

1. **Company Size**: Larger partners should typically carry higher insurance limits.
2. **Client Size/Industry**: Enterprise clients or those in regulated industries often require higher limits.
3. **Project Value**: Higher-value projects justify higher insurance requirements.
4. **Risk Profile**: Consider the potential impact of project failure when setting limits.

Common insurance limits for ecommerce implementation partners:
- Small partners: $1M-$2M per occurrence
- Medium partners: $2M-$5M per occurrence
- Large partners: $5M+ per occurrence

#### Acceptance Testing Period

The appropriate acceptance testing period depends on:

1. **Implementation Complexity**: More complex implementations warrant longer testing periods.
2. **Client Resources**: Clients with limited technical resources may need more time.
3. **Project Timeline**: Consider the overall project timeline when setting this period.

Typical ranges:
- Simple implementations: 5-10 business days
- Moderate implementations: 10-15 business days
- Complex implementations: 15-20 business days

### 3. Industry-Specific Considerations

#### Retail & Fashion

For retail and fashion clients, consider:
- Additional indemnification for product compliance issues
- Specific provisions addressing seasonal business impacts
- Security incident language focusing on payment and customer data

#### B2B Commerce

For B2B implementation projects, consider:
- Higher liability caps reflecting larger transaction values
- Additional provisions for ERP integration failures
- Specific language addressing business continuity requirements

#### Subscription-Based Businesses

For subscription or recurring revenue clients, consider:
- Provisions addressing recurring revenue impacts
- Specific performance guarantees for subscription processing
- Enhanced data protection provisions

### 4. Common Negotiation Points

Be prepared to negotiate these common client requests:

1. **Mutual Indemnification**: Clients often request that all indemnification provisions be mutual.

2. **Higher Liability Caps**: Enterprise clients may push for higher liability caps or uncapped liability for certain breaches.

3. **Consequential Damages**: Some clients may resist the exclusion of consequential damages.

4. **Security Requirements**: Clients with strict security policies may require additional or more stringent security provisions.

5. **Insurance Requirements**: Clients may request to be added as additional insureds on your policies.

Recommended compromise positions:
- Agree to mutual indemnification with appropriate carve-outs
- Consider higher caps for specific critical breaches rather than removing caps entirely
- Maintain consequential damage exclusions but consider limited exceptions
- Accept reasonable security requirements that align with your existing practices
- Allow clients to be named as additional insureds where appropriate

## Conclusion

These liability and indemnification provisions are designed to provide a balanced framework for risk allocation between Store.icu implementation partners and their clients. When properly customized and incorporated into your agreements, they can help protect your business while maintaining fair and reasonable terms for your clients.

Remember that these provisions should evolve with your business and the changing legal landscape. Regular review and updates, in consultation with legal counsel, are recommended to ensure ongoing protection.
