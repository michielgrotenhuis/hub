# Sales Scripts

## Conversational Frameworks for Effective Sales Dialogues

These sales scripts provide structured conversational frameworks to help partners navigate key client interactions effectively. Rather than rigid scripts to be followed verbatim, these frameworks offer flexible starting points that can be customized to your personal style and specific client scenarios.

## Using These Scripts

### Adaptation Guidelines

To make these scripts most effective:

1. **Personalize the language** to match your natural speaking style
2. **Customize examples** specific to the prospect's industry and situation
3. **Adjust the technical depth** based on the audience's knowledge level
4. **Prepare for diversions** from the script flow based on prospect responses
5. **Practice until internalized** rather than reading verbatim

### Conversation Principles

For authentic, effective conversations:

1. **Listen more than you speak** - aim for 30% talking, 70% listening
2. **Ask thoughtful follow-up questions** based on prospect responses
3. **Paraphrase and validate** to demonstrate understanding
4. **Bridge from their needs** to relevant platform capabilities
5. **Focus on business outcomes** rather than technical features
6. **Adjust your pace** to match the prospect's communication style

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I memorize these scripts word-for-word?**  
A: No, these scripts are conversation frameworks, not verbatim dialogs. Internalize the structure and key talking points, then adapt the language to your natural communication style. The goal is to cover all important elements while maintaining an authentic conversation.

**Q: How do I balance following the script with being responsive to the prospect?**  
A: Active listening should always take priority. Use the scripts as a guide for the overall conversation flow and to ensure you cover key points, but be flexible in responding to the prospect's specific concerns and interests. Don't force the conversation back to your script at the expense of addressing what matters most to them.

**Q: Can I use these scripts in written communications?**  
A: These scripts are designed primarily for verbal conversations, but the key talking points and structure can be adapted for emails and other written communications. Just be sure to adjust the tone and format appropriately for written form, which typically requires more conciseness and clarity.

**Q: How do I customize these for different industries?**  
A: Start by replacing generic examples with industry-specific challenges and solutions. Use terminology familiar to that industry, reference relevant benchmarks and trends, and incorporate case studies from similar companies. The script structure remains valuable across industries, but the specific content should reflect industry-specific concerns.

**Q: What if the prospect takes the conversation in a completely different direction?**  
A: Follow their lead while looking for opportunities to guide the conversation back to key qualification areas. If their direction reveals important information about their needs or concerns, explore that fully before transitioning back to your framework. The scripts should serve you, not constrain productive conversation.

**Q: How should I practice these scripts to make them natural?**  
A: Start by reading them to understand the flow, then practice delivering key sections without reading. Role-play with colleagues, record yourself and review, and gradually incorporate the frameworks into actual prospect conversations. After each conversation, review what worked well and what felt unnatural, then adjust accordingly.

**Q: Can I share these scripts with prospects or clients?**  
A: No, these scripts are for internal use only. They represent our sales methodology and approach, which is proprietary information. Sharing them externally would reduce their effectiveness and could negatively impact the perception of our sales process.
