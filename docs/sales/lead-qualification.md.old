## Frequently Asked Questions

### Lead Qualification Questions

**Q: How do we handle prospects with unrealistic budget expectations?**  
A: Education is key. Share the ROI calculator and typical implementation ranges early in discussions. Explore phased approaches that can align with budget constraints while setting realistic expectations. Some prospects may not be ready now but can become qualified over time as they secure appropriate budget.

**Q: What's the best approach for prospects comparing multiple platforms?**  
A: Focus on their specific business requirements rather than feature-by-feature comparisons. Use the competitive battle cards to highlight Store.icu's unique advantages for their use case. Ask targeted questions about what they value most in a platform and align your positioning accordingly. Remember that being included in a competitive evaluation is a positive sign of qualification.

**Q: How do we qualify leads that come through the website with minimal information?**  
A: Implement a progressive qualification process. Begin with a brief initial call focused purely on understanding their needs and sharing high-level information. Use the Initial Qualification Checklist to efficiently assess if they meet basic criteria before investing significant time. Based on that assessment, determine whether to proceed with a full discovery session.

**Q: When should we disqualify a prospect?**  
A: Disqualify prospects when: 1) Their requirements fundamentally misalign with platform capabilities, 2) Their budget is significantly below implementation viability with no path to increase, 3) Their timeline is unrealistically short with no flexibility, 4) They exhibit multiple red flags from the checklist, or 5) They have no clear decision-making process or authority. Disqualifying poor-fit prospects preserves resources for opportunities with higher success potential.

**Q: How do we handle prospects who won't share budget information?**  
A: First, understand that budget reluctance is common. Instead of asking for a specific number, provide ballpark ranges for similar implementations and gauge their reaction. Alternatively, discuss the business case and ROI first, then transition to investment levels required to achieve those returns. If they remain completely unwilling to discuss financial parameters after multiple attempts, this could be a qualification red flag.

### Technical Qualification Questions

**Q: How do we evaluate technical fit when the prospect has highly specialized requirements?**  
A: For specialized requirements, involve a solution architect in the qualification process. Conduct a focused technical discovery session to understand the specific needs in detail. Use the Solution Alignment Matrix to evaluate core platform capabilities against their requirements. For truly unique needs, consider a brief proof-of-concept exercise to validate technical feasibility before proceeding.

**Q: What's the best way to qualify integration complexity?**  
A: Develop a clear picture of their integration landscape early in discussions. Identify all systems that must connect with the ecommerce platform, the data flows between systems, synchronization frequency requirements, and any custom integrations. For complex integration scenarios, involve technical specialists who can assess feasibility and level of effort before providing estimates.

**Q: How do we assess a prospect's internal technical capabilities?**  
A: Evaluate their current team structure, roles, experience with similar platforms, and planned involvement in the implementation. Ask about their experience with previous technology projects and how they were resourced. This helps identify potential skill gaps, determine the appropriate level of partner services, and ensure realistic expectations about client responsibilities.

**Q: When should we recommend a phased approach versus full implementation?**  
A: Recommend phased implementation when: 1) The project has high complexity with numerous integrations, 2) The prospect has budget constraints but long-term vision, 3) There are tight timeline requirements for core functionality, 4) The organization has limited change management capacity, or 5) There are mission-critical components that must be prioritized. Clearly outline the advantages of phasing and present a comprehensive roadmap that achieves their complete vision over time.

### General Business Questions

**Q: How do we prioritize multiple qualified opportunities with limited resources?**  
A: Use the lead scoring model to objectively evaluate and compare opportunities. Prioritize prospects with higher scores, shorter sales cycles, and better alignment with your firm's expertise and capacity. Consider the strategic value of each opportunity beyond immediate revenue, including long-term relationship potential, industry penetration, and reference value.

**Q: What's the most effective way to use customer references in the qualification process?**  
A: References are most effective late in the qualification process when prospects are evaluating final options. Match references to the prospect's industry, size, and use case for maximum impact. Prepare references with specific talking points related to the prospect's concerns. Use case studies earlier in the process, reserving direct customer references for serious prospects nearing decision.

**Q: How do we balance qualification rigor with sales velocity?**  
A: Focus initial qualification on the most critical factors that determine fit and viability. Use the Initial Qualification Checklist to quickly assess basic fit before investing in comprehensive discovery. Adjust the depth of qualification to the opportunity size—larger, more complex deals warrant more thorough qualification. Remember that proper qualification actually accelerates velocity by focusing efforts on viable opportunities.

**Q: How do we effectively qualify opportunities coming from existing clients (upsell/cross-sell)?**  
A: While existing relationships provide advantages, still conduct appropriate qualification. Focus on the specific business case for the new services, confirmation of budget allocation, and decision process for this purchase (which may differ from previous engagements). Leverage your understanding of their business and technical environment, but don't assume all new opportunities from existing clients will automatically close.
