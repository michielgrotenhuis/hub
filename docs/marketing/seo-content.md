## 🧱 SEO Basics for Your Reseller Site

### 1. Keyword Research -  Start with Intent-Based Keywords

Focus on **search intent** — what users are actually trying to do.

|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Informational | Blog post        | how to start an online store | Step-by-step guide          |
| Navigational  | Landing page     | [Your Brand] site builder   | Homepage or comparison page |
| Transactional | Product/feature  | best eCommerce builder 2025 | Features/pricing page       |
| Commercial    | Comparison/review| Shopify vs [Your Brand]     | Head-to-head page           |

**Tools to use:**
- Google Search suggestions
- "People Also Ask" boxes
- Ubersuggest, Ahrefs, SEMrush
Use tools like:
- Google Keyword Planner

**Target search terms like:**
- *“best online store builder 2025”*
- *“no-code ecommerce platform”*
- *“launch an online shop easily”*

👉 Use these keywords naturally in your landing pages, blog posts, meta titles, and product descriptions.

### 2. On-Page SEO Best Practices
