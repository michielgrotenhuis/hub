## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can we create our own branded version of Store.icu documentation?**  
A: Partners may create supplementary documentation focused on implementation methodology and best practices, but may not recreate or rebrand official Store.icu platform documentation. Always refer clients to the official documentation for platform capabilities and maintain clear distinction between platform documentation and your custom materials.

**Q: Are we allowed to create and publish comparison charts between Store.icu and competitors?**  
A: Yes, with specific requirements. Comparison content must: 1) Use only factual, verifiable information, 2) Focus on objective capability differences rather than subjective judgments, 3) Be submitted for review before publication, 4) Be updated when platform capabilities change, and 5) Include your partnership designation. Use the approved [Competitive Comparison Template](https://partners.store.icu/competitive-template) as a starting point.

**Q: Can we mention specific Store.icu clients in our marketing?**  
A: You may only mention Store.icu clients that you directly implemented, and only with their explicit permission. When referencing these implementations, clearly identify your role in the project and do not imply direct endorsement of your services by Store.icu. For clients implemented by other partners or by Store.icu directly, do not use their names or suggest any connection to your services.

**Q: How do we handle price advertising for Store.icu?**  
A: Partners should not advertise specific Store.icu platform pricing unless following the [Pricing Communication Guidelines](https://partners.store.icu/pricing-guidelines). Generally, focus on value-based messaging rather than specific price points, as pricing structures may vary. When including implementation services, clearly distinguish between platform costs and your service fees to maintain pricing transparency.

**Q: Can we create our own demo videos of the platform?**  
A: Yes, partners may create demo videos with these requirements: 1) Use only current platform versions, 2) Focus on standard functionality rather than customizations unless clearly identified, 3) Include your partnership designation, 4) Avoid revealing sensitive platform areas, and 5) Submit for review before public distribution. Consider using the [Partner Demo Environment](https://partners.store.icu/demo-environment) for consistent examples.

**Q: What should we do if we find another partner violating these guidelines?**  
A: Report potential guideline violations through the [Partner Feedback Form](https://partners.store.icu/feedback) with specific examples and documentation. Do not directly confront other partners about perceived violations. Store.icu will investigate all reports confidentially and take appropriate action according to the enforcement policy. Focus your energy on positive differentiation rather than policing other partners.

**Q: How quickly will our marketing materials be reviewed?**  
A: Standard review times are 5 business days for most materials, with expedited 2-business-day review available for time-sensitive items (Gold and Platinum partners only). Complex materials like case studies or whitepapers may require additional time. Plan your marketing calendar accordingly and submit materials well in advance of publication deadlines, especially for major campaigns or events.
