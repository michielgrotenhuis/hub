Creating a compelling landing page is key to converting visitors into paying users of your white-labeled eCommerce builder powered by **store.icu**. This guide outlines best practices and includes examples to inspire your design and messaging.

## üéØ Goal of Your Landing Page

Your landing page should:

Grab attention and clearly state the main value.

**Examples:**

### 2. **Subheadline**
Explain the main benefit in one sentence.

**Example:**

### 3. **Call to Action (CTA)**
Use clear, compelling CTAs above the fold and throughout the page.

Use icons or illustrations to make features scannable.

### 5. **Visual Demo**
Add screenshots or GIFs of the builder in action. A short explainer video also works well.

Include testimonials, star ratings, or logos of businesses using your platform.

**Example Testimonial:**
> ‚ÄúI built my first store in under 30 minutes. This platform made it easy!‚Äù
