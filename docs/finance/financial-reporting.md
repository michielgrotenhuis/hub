### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: When are commissions calculated and paid?**  
A: Commissions are calculated by the 5th business day of each month for the previous month's activity. Partners have until the 10th to review and dispute calculations. Payments are processed on the 15th of each month, with funds typically available between the 15th and 20th depending on payment method and region.

**Q: How long does deal registration protection last?**  
A: Deal registration protection periods vary based on opportunity size: 90 days for deals under $50,000, 120 days for deals between $50,001-$150,000, and 180 days for deals above $150,001. One extension is available per registration if requested at least 14 days before expiration and with evidence of continued active sales engagement.

**Q: What happens if two partners register the same client?**  
A: The first complete registration receives priority based on submission timestamp. If both partners demonstrate active engagement, the Channel Conflicts team will review specific evidence of meaningful client engagement from both partners and make a determination within 5 business days. In some cases, a commission split may be implemented based on the relative contribution of each partner.

**Q: How are commissions calculated for renewals?**  
A: Renewal commissions are paid to the partner of record at the rate specified in the commission structure table (20% for Platinum, 15% for Gold, 10% for Silver). Renewals are eligible for payment when the client completes their renewal payment. Expansion revenue during renewal is treated as new business for commission purposes.

**Q: What documentation is required for international payments?**  
A: International partners must provide: (1) Complete W-8 series form appropriate for their entity type and country, (2) Banking information including SWIFT/BIC codes, (3) Tax residency certificate if claiming treaty benefits, (4) VAT/GST registration if applicable in their jurisdiction, and (5) Any country-specific tax documentation required by local regulations.

**Q: How do I dispute a commission payment?**  
A: Commission disputes must be submitted through the Partner Portal dispute form within 30 days of the commission statement date. Provide specific transaction details, document the expected versus received amount, and include supporting evidence. Standard disputes are resolved within 15 business days, while complex disputes may take up to 30 business days.

**Q: What happens if my client doesn't pay their subscription?**  
A: Commissions are subject to clawback if a client fails to pay within 90 days of the commission payment. We recommend verifying client payment receipt before counting on commission payouts. The Partner Portal shows payment status for all client subscriptions, with clear indicators for pending or failed payments.
