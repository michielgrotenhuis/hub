# Bug Reporting

## Reporting and Tracking Platform Issues

Effective bug reporting is essential for maintaining the quality and reliability of the Store.icu platform. This guide outlines the processes, best practices, and tools available to partners for reporting and tracking issues.

## Bug Reporting Process

### When to Report a Bug

Report an issue when you encounter:

- Unexpected behavior that differs from documentation
- System errors or crash scenarios
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities
- UI inconsistencies or rendering problems
- Functionality that doesn't work as described
- API responses that don't match specifications

### Before Submitting a Report

To ensure efficient resolution, complete these pre-reporting steps:

1. **Verify the issue**:
   - Confirm it's reproducible in a clean environment
   - Test in multiple browsers or devices if interface-related
   - Check if the issue occurs in both sandbox and production

2. **Check known issues**:
   - Review the [Known Issues Dashboard](https://partners.store.icu/known-issues)
